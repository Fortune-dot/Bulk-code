<h1>Javascript -Switch Case</h1>
<br><br>
<div class="container">
<p>
You can use multiple <span>if..else..if</span> statements,as in the previous chapter,to perform a multiway branch.However,this is not always the best solution,especially when all the branches depend on the value of a single variable.
<br>
Starting with Javascript 1.2,you can use a <span>switch</span> statement which handles exactly this situation and does this more efficiently than <span>if..else if </span>statements.
<br>
<h3>Flow Chart</h3>
<br>
The following chart explains how a switch-case statement works.

//...............
<br>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<br>
The objective of a <span>switch</span> statement is to give an expression to evaluate and several different statements to execute based on the value of the expression. The interpreter checks each <span>case</span> against the value of the expression until a match is found.If nothing matches,a <span>default</span> condition will be used.
<br>
//........
<br>
The <span>break</span> statements indicate the end of a particular case.If they were omitted,the interpreter would continue executing each statement in each of the following cases.
<br>
We will explain <span>break</span> statement in <span>Loop Control</span> chapter.
<br>
<h3>Example</h3>
<br>
Try the following example to implement swith-case statement.
