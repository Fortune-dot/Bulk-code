<h2>Javascript -if..else Statement</h2>
<br><br>
<div class="container">
<p>
While writing a program,there may be a situation when you need to adopt one out of given set of paths.In such cases,you need to use conditional Statements that allow your program to make correct decisions and perform right actions.
<br>
Javascript supports conditional statements which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.Here we will explain the <span>if...else</span> statement.
<br>
<h3>Flow chart of if-else</h3>
<br>
The following attempts to summarise how the if-else statements work.
<br>
//...........
<br>
Javascript supports the following forms of <span>if..else</span> statement-
<br>
<ul>
    <li>if statement</li>
    <li>if..else statement</li>
    <li>if..else..if statement</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>if statement</h3>
<br>
The <span>if</span> statement is the fundamental control statement that allows Javascript to make decisions and execute statements conditionally.
<br>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<br>
The syntax for a basic if statement is as follows-
<br>
//..........
<br>
Here a Javascript expression is evaluated.If the resulting value,the given statement(s) are executed .If the expression is false,then no statement is executed.Most of the times,you will use Comparison operators while making decisions.
<br>
<h3>Example</h3>
<br>
Try the following example to find out how the <span>if</span> statement works
<br>
//..................
<br>
<h3>Output</h3>
<br>
//.............
<br>
<h3>if..else statement</h3>
<br>
The <span>if..else</span> statement is the next form of control statement that allows Javascript to execute statements in a more controlled way.
<br>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<br>
//...........
<br>
Here Javascript expression is evaluated.If the resulting value is true ,the given statements  in the "if" block,are executed.If the expression is false,then the given statements in the "else" block are executed.
<br>
<h3>Example</h3>
<br>
Try the folowing code to understand how to implement an if..else statement in Javascript.
<br>
//................
<br>
<h3>Output</h3>
<br>
//,.........
<br>
<h3>if..else if..statement</h3>
<br>
The <span>if..else if..</span> statement is an advanced form of <span>if..else</span> that allows Javascript to make a correct out of several conditions.
<br>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<br>
The syntax of an if-else-if statement is as follows-
<br>
//.........
<br>
There is nothing special about this code.It is just a series of <span>if</span> statements ,where each <span>if</span> is just a part of the <span>else</span>
clause of the previous Statement.Statement(s) are executed based on the true condition,if none of the conditions is true,then the <span>else</span> block is executed.
<br>
<h3>Example</h3>
<br>
Try the following code to learn how to use an if..else.if statement in Javascript.
